Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client for this design was The Gaming Room. They were wanting to design a multi-platform application based of their web based game, Draw It or Lose It. Their requirements were:
A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved.
Each team will have multiple players assigned to it.
Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.
Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Identifying requirements and constraints along with interacting with the UML Diagram.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
UML diagrams are a huge help with the code. I didn't struggle at all with the coding and all the intentions of the design were clear.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The overall recommendations. In hindsight, I was to hands off, like I still wanted the client to make the decisions. I should have been more definite in saying "We need to use this specific setting."

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I tried to put myself in the client's perspective and I tried to compare what they have vs what they were trying to achieve. Obviously, the user's needs and desires are important because they are paying you to create the image they have in mind. You wouldn't want to order a meal at a restaurant only to get something completely different. They're the paying customer, you're the chef. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I think the main thing to keep in mind is the client's limitations and wants. I try to approach it not by what is the best way to design it, but rather what is the best way to design it for the client. I hope to fully utilize writing and reading UML diagrams, they were my favorite tool to use.
